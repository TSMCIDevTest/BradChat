## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up BradChat on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed.

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (usually comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TSMCIDevTest/BradChat.git
    cd BradChat
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required packages in the root of the repo.

    ```bash
    npm run build # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required packages in the root of the repo.

    ```bash
    npm run build # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    From the `backend` directory, start the server in the root of the repo.

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or node server.js (depending on your backend's main script)
    ```

    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar port).

5.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**

    From the `frontend` directory, start the development server in the root of the repo.

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn start
    ```

    The frontend application will usually open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or `http://localhost:3000` if using Create React App, etc.).


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

1.  **Connect to a Chat:** Upon loading the page, you will typically be prompted to connect or automatically matched with another user.
2.  **Send Messages:** Type your message in the input field at the bottom of the chat window and press Enter or click the send button.
3.  **End Chat:** Look for an option to disconnect or find a new chat partner if available.
